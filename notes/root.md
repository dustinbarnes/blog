This is my blog. It's not monetized, there's no analytics. It's probably not great at SEO. But it's simple, it's text-based, and it's interconnected. 

I am using a tool called dendron to make this site. It's similar to other personal knowledge management (PKM) tools, but it has some advantages

In theory, I'll actually address those advantages somehwere in here.
