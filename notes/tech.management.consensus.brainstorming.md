Brainstorming is a simple and effective way to get ideas out of people. 

- Facilitator defines problem/topic
- Each team member suggests ideas
- Ideas written on board
- No criticizing/evaluating ideas yet

After this is done, the list needs to be refined: 

- Combine ideas
- Gather explanations

Then it's time for [[tech.management.prioritization]]!
