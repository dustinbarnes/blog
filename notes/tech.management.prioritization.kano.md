Features are categorized according to needs and expectations of customers. There are some variations, however the original Kano method classifies items using five thresholds: Must-be, Attractive, One-Dimensional, Indifferent, and Reverse.

- **Must-Be** — These are expected by your customers. They are features that will not WOW them. They must be included in your product, and are often taken for granted. Often called 'Table Stakes'

- **Attractive** — These make users happy when they’re there, but don’t disappoint them when they’re not.

- **One-Dimensional** — These are features that make users happy when they’re there, unhappy when they’re not.

- **Indifferent** — These have no impact on customer satisfaction levels. For example, refactoring parts of your code so that it is easier to read and understand. There is no direct value to the customer, but it will make it easier for you to maintain in the future.

- **Reverse** — These make users unhappy when they’re there, happy when they’re not. For example, you might implement high-security features requiring an extra step to login. However, if customers do not value enhanced security, they will become dissatisfied with the extra step.
