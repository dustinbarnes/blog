Multi-voting can reduce a list containing a large number of items to a manageable few. 

- Each person gets some number of votes
- Members vote on each idea they think are best
    - Only one vote per item per person

Once everyone has voted, re-order the items with the most votes first

This process can then repeat again, if fewer items are needed.
