<p>Treat logs as event streams</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Logs provide insight into a running app's behaviour.</li>
<li>Logs are streams of aggregated, time-ordered events collected from output streams of <a href="/blog/notes/12fa-06-processes">Processes</a> and <a href="/blog/notes/12fa-04-backing-services">Backing Services</a>.
<ul>
<li>Raw form is typically text.</li>
<li>We can mutate them into more structured data formats.</li>
<li>No fixed beginning or end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apps don't concern themselves with the routing or storage of their output.
<ul>
<li>They write to stdout.</li>
<li>Local execution during development allows developers to see the logs via their terminal.</li>
<li>In deployed environments we can capture and retain this stream.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The event stream is handled by the deployment environment, enabling:
<ul>
<li>Finding historical events.</li>
<li>Graphing trends.</li>
<li>Active alerting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
