Consensus means coming to an agreement. Creating consensus in a team setting means finding a proposal acceptable enough that all team members can support it, with no member opposing it. 

Consensus includes:

- pooling opinions;
- listening effectively;
- discussing ideas and differences;
- not getting all you want; and
- coming to an agreement that everyone "can live with."

Consensus is not:

- a unanimous vote;
- majority or minority rule;
- one person rule; or
- bargaining.
