<p>Fist of Five is a means of establishing consensus in a group. </p>
<p>Everyone is asked to show their agreement with a statement by holding up a number of fingers.</p>
<p>Numbers generally mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of consensus:
<ul>
<li>0: I'll block this.</li>
<li>1: I see major issues we need to resolve now.</li>
<li>2: I see minor issues we need to resolve now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consensus:
<ul>
<li>3: I see minor issues we can resolve later.</li>
<li>4: I'm okay with this as it is.</li>
<li>5: I love this, and will champion it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
