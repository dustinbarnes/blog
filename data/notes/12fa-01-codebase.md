> One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys


- Everything always tracked in version control.
- 1:1 correlation between the codebase and the app
  - Mutiple codebases represent a distributed system. Each component can individually comply with the principles.
  - One codebase per app, but many deploys (running instances).
