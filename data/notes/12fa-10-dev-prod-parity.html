<p>Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Gaps between development and production manifest in three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The time gap:</strong> A developer may work on code that takes days, weeks, or even months to go into production.</li>
<li><strong>The personnel gap:</strong> Developers write code, ops engineers deploy it.</li>
<li><strong>The tools gap:</strong> Developers may be using a stack like Nginx, SQLite, and OS X, while the production deploy uses Apache, MySQL, and Linux.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apps are designed for Continuous Delivery by shrinking these gaps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the time gap small: a developer may write code and have it deployed hours or even just minutes later.</li>
<li>Make the personnel gap small: developers who wrote code are closely involved in deploying it and watching its behavior in production.</li>
<li>Make the tools gap small: keep development and production as similar as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gaps === risk</p>
