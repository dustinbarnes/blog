<blockquote>
<p>Strictly separate build and run stages</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Three stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Build</strong> is a transform of source code into an executable bundle called a build. Using a specified commit, this stage fetches dependencies and compiles binaries/assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Release</strong> takes the build produced above and combines it with a deploy's Configuration. The release contains both the build and the config, ready for immediate execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run</strong> runs the app in an execution environment by launching processes against a selected release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Releases should be uniquely identifiable from a timestamp or version identifier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Releases are an append-only ledger and a release cannot be mutated once it is created. Any change must create a new release.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shift left: the run stage should be kept as simple as possible to ensure engineers aren't required for recovery during unsociable hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
