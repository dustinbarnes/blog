<p>Multi-voting can reduce a list containing a large number of items to a manageable few. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each person gets some number of votes</li>
<li>Members vote on each idea they think are best
<ul>
<li>Only one vote per item per person</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once everyone has voted, re-order the items with the most votes first</p>
<p>This process can then repeat again, if fewer items are needed.</p>
