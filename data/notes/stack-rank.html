<p>Stack-ranking is a technique where the items to be prioritized are put in a ranked order from most to least important.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There can only be one number one.</strong> So, you will avoid a common pitfall where everything becomes very high priority.</li>
<li><strong>It is often more accurate, less confusing.</strong> You prioritize each item relative to all other items, which is simpler and clearer. </li>
</ul>
