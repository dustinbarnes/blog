Fist of Five is a means of establishing consensus in a group. 

Everyone is asked to show their agreement with a statement by holding up a number of fingers.

Numbers generally mean:

- Lack of consensus:
    - 0: I'll block this.
    - 1: I see major issues we need to resolve now.
    - 2: I see minor issues we need to resolve now.
- Consensus:
    - 3: I see minor issues we can resolve later.
    - 4: I'm okay with this as it is.
    - 5: I love this, and will champion it.
