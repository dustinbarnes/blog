Stack-ranking is a technique where the items to be prioritized are put in a ranked order from most to least important.

- **There can only be one number one.** So, you will avoid a common pitfall where everything becomes very high priority.
- **It is often more accurate, less confusing.** You prioritize each item relative to all other items, which is simpler and clearer.
