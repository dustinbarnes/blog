# SemVer Purpose
SemVer is a way to version software such that compatibility can be programatically communicated to downstream users. 

This is done to allow package managers to automatically pick up compatible changes. In theory, this allows downstream users to stay up-to-date on security and bug fixes without having to think about it. Therefore, only when the `MAJOR` version changes do they have to spend effort updating.
