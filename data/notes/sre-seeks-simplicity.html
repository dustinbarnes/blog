<p>Simplicity is efficiency.</p>
<p>John Gall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system, designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a simple working system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Measures of complexity</p>
<ul>
<li>Cylomatic complexity measures the number of paths (in the form of branches and loops) through software source code.</li>
<li>Training time for new hires.</li>
<li>How much explanation time is required for a comprehensive, high-level overview.</li>
<li>How much administrative diversity is enabled through configuration.</li>
<li>The diversity between deployed environments.</li>
<li>Age of the system, per Hyrum's Law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules of thumb</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal with complexity upfront (e.g. API design, typing and documentation for forward and backward compatibility).</li>
<li>Consider the full lifecycle of rewrite projects, including developing against a moving target, a full migration plan and additional costs incurred during migration.</li>
</ul>
