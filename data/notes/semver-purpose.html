<p>SemVer is a way to version software such that compatibility can be programatically communicated to downstream users. </p>
<p>This is done to allow package managers to automatically pick up compatible changes. In theory, this allows downstream users to stay up-to-date on security and bug fixes without having to think about it. Therefore, only when the <code>MAJOR</code> version changes do they have to spend effort updating. </p>
