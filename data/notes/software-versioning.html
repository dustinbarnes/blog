<p>The only actual, functional requirement of a version is that it uniquely identifies a build of software. </p>
<p>That's all a version does. Everything else is folks applying their comfort levels and background to how it should be done. </p>

<p>This is not a requirement of a version. It's simply a practice that most people have adopted out of convenience and convention. When you're trying to figure out what version scheme to adopt, you'll likely make this a point of consideration. </p>
<p>You might choose to drop this convention in CI/CD pipelines, as the git commit ref can often suffice as the version. </p>

<p>This is a convention of the industry, but not required. Some tools version based on codenames, and most of the industry has accepted some postfix string to further classify builds (-alpha, -beta, rc1, etc)</p>
<p>Then, you have to consider if you're zero-padding, how many items to have (3 is conventional, 2 and 4 are not uncommon). </p>
