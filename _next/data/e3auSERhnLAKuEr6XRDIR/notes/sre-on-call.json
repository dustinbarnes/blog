This reduces impact to the error budget. Roll out features behind flags so that they can easily be disabled when problems arise.</li>\n<li>Consider automating changes currently made by humans, allowing for greater validation and testing.</li>\n<li>Reduce identification delay by changes to alerting and the operational playbook. Practice emergency response, limit the size of releases and log changes.
