Some may say this means a poor up-front design, but it ignores some real-world concerns. Let's walk through some examples:</p>\n<h2 id=\"behavioral-change\">Behavioral Change<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#behavioral-change\"></a></h2>\n<p>Initial code:</p>\n<pre><code>function doThing(text) {\n    return text.replace('&#x3C;>', 'Your Name Here');\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>New code:</p>\n<pre><code>function doThing(text) {\n    return text\n      .replace('&#x3C;>', 'Your Name Here')\n      .replace('[]', 'Your Address Here');\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Contractually and by the public API, nothing has changed. It's still a <code>f(string) => string</code> function. However, users that depended upon '[]' passing through unfiltered will now experience a break.</p>\n<p>This is a breaking change, and requires a major version bump -- unless you explicitly documented that things like <code>[]</code> or <code>()</code> are future reserved tokens. </p>\n<h2 id=\"performance-changes\">Performance Changes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#performance-changes\"></a></h2>\n<p>If you introduce a change where you have the same function, with the same shape, but the previous version executed in O(1) time, and the new version executes in O(N) time.</p>\n<p>Without any changes to the API interface itself, you're introducing a potentially breaking change. </p>\n<h2 id=\"automated-testing\">Automated Testing<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#automated-testing\"></a></h2>\n<p>Your automated test are the closest most teams have to Consumer Contract Testing. Any time a test breaks, it indicates a behavior change. Ergo, any time you fix a test, that's a major version bump. </p>\n<p>By changing the behavior of your contract (say, by fixing a bug) and updating your automated tests (to ensure new behavior persists, and to prevent regression), you are establishing a break to your API. </p>\n<h2 id=\"theyre-all-potentially-breaking\">They're All Potentially Breaking!<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#theyre-all-potentially-breaking\"></a></h2>\n<p>There's a very strong argument to be made that every change to the system is a breaking change. I know it sounds like pedantic wordplay, but we're talking about a versioning scheme whose primary purpose is to allow the automatic and error-free update of dependency upgrades (and their transitive dependencies). </p>\n<p>So long as a human is hedging the definition of a breaking change or staying at ZeroVer or somehow putting their fingers on the scale, this effort is insufficient. </p>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Dustin Barnes","desc":"","updated":1681759798693,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"},"contentHash":"3ebb4073bdee31751a155bb33051029a","links":[],"anchors":{"dustin-barnes":{"type":"header","text":"Dustin Barnes","value":"dustin-barnes","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["articles","concepts","xufh3s1pjwin0pvew6jmu8j"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Dustin Barnes\n\nThis is my digital garden.
