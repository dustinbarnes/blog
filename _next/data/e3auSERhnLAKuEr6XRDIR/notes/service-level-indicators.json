Systems generally fit into a classification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User-facing systems, e.g. search engines, care about availability, latency and throughput.</li>\n<li>Storage systems emphasise latency, availability and durability.</li>\n<li>Big data systems care about throughput and end-to-end latency.</li>\n<li>All systems care about correctness, though this is outside of the SRE purview and usually lies with the product team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Collection is usually server-side, either using time series data or periodic log analysis. Don't forget the client-side though: richer applications are prone to slowdowns and bugs that won't be detectable from the server-side, and these still hurt user experience.</p>\n<p>Use distributions over averages for aggregation to catch long tail. Percentiles (50th, 99th and 99.9th, for instance) will show the average case whilst still allowing us to identify pathological cases.</p>\n<p>Standardising indicators allows shared understanding without having to always reason about the meaning of a metric:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intervals (averaged over 1 minute)</li>\n<li>Regions (all tasks in a cluster)</li>\n<li>Measurement frequency (every 10 seconds)</li>\n<li>Which transactions are included (HTTP PUTs from tool X)</li>\n<li>Acquisition (server-side, client-side)</li>\n<li>Data-access latency (time to first byte, time to last byte)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Measurement strategies</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Application-level metrics</li>\n<li>Logs processing</li>\n<li>Frontend infrastructure metrics</li>\n<li>Synthetic clients/data</li>\n<li>Client-side instrumentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Verification</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can we measure the SLIs we've created where we want to measure them, given this infrastructure?</li>\n<li>Do the SLIs adequately capture the user journey and its failure modes?</li>\n<li>Are there any exceptions or edge cases to consider?</li>\n<li>Do the SLIs capture multiple journeys with differing requirements?</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Dustin Barnes","desc":"","updated":1681759798693,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"},"contentHash":"3ebb4073bdee31751a155bb33051029a","links":[],"anchors":{"dustin-barnes":{"type":"header","text":"Dustin Barnes","value":"dustin-barnes","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["articles","concepts","xufh3s1pjwin0pvew6jmu8j"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Dustin Barnes\n\nThis is my digital garden.
