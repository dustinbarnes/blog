Although the language is not a general-purpose programming language, it has many applications, such as data validation, data templating, configuration, querying, code generation and even scripting. The inference engine can be used to validate data in code or to include it as part of a code generation pipeline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A key thing that sets CUE apart from its peer languages is that it merges types and values into a single concept. Whereas in most languages types and values are strictly distinct, CUE orders them in a single hierarchy (a lattice, to be precise). This is a very powerful concept that allows CUE to do many fancy things. It also simplifies matters. For instance, there is no need for generics and enums, sum types and null coalescing are all the same thing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CUEâ€™s design ensures that combining CUE values in any order always gives the same result (it is associative, commutative and idempotent). This makes CUE particularly well-suited for cases where CUE constraints are combined from different sources:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Data validation: different departments or groups can each define their own constraints to apply to the same set of data.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Code extraction and generation: extract CUE definitions from multiple sources (Go code, Protobuf), combine them into a single definition, and use that to generate definitions in another format (e.g. OpenAPI).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Configuration: values can be combined from different sources without one having to import the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ordering of values also allows set containment analysis of entire configurations. Where most validation systems are limited to checking whether a concrete value matches a schema, CUE can validate whether any instance of one schema is also an instance of another (is it backwards compatible?), or compute a new schema that represents all instances that match two other schema.</p>\n</blockquote>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Dustin Barnes","desc":"","updated":1681759798693,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"},"contentHash":"3ebb4073bdee31751a155bb33051029a","links":[],"anchors":{"dustin-barnes":{"type":"header","text":"Dustin Barnes","value":"dustin-barnes","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["articles","concepts","xufh3s1pjwin0pvew6jmu8j"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Dustin Barnes\n\nThis is my digital garden.
