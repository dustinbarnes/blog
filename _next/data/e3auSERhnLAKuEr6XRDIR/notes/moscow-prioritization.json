Rather, it takes its name from the letters that make up its criteria: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won’t Have.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Must Have</strong> — If you would have to cancel your release if you couldn’t include it, then it’s a Must Have. Must-Have items are those that you guarantee to deliver because you can’t deliver without, or it would be illegal or unsafe without. If there’s <strong>any</strong> way to deliver without it — a workaround, for example — then it should be downgraded to Should Have or Could Have. That doesn’t mean it won’t be delivered. It means that that delivery is not guaranteed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Should Have</strong> — Should Have items are important, but not absolutely vital to the success of your release. They can be painful to leave out, and may have an impact on your product, but they don’t affect minimum viability of your product.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Could Have</strong> — Could Have items are those that are wanted or desirable but are less important than a Should Have item. Leaving them out will cause less pain than a Should Have item.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Won’t Have</strong> — Won’t Have user stories are those in which everyone has agreed not to deliver this time around. You may keep it in the backlog for later, if or when it becomes necessary to do so.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Dustin Barnes","desc":"","updated":1681759798693,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"},"contentHash":"3ebb4073bdee31751a155bb33051029a","links":[],"anchors":{"dustin-barnes":{"type":"header","text":"Dustin Barnes","value":"dustin-barnes","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["articles","concepts","xufh3s1pjwin0pvew6jmu8j"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Dustin Barnes\n\nThis is my digital garden.
